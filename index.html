          If you wanna know how I trained this neural network and predicted the results, read <a href="/mlp">this</a><span style="color:rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.63); font-size: small;">➚</span><br><br>
          Btw your next semester division predictions are <a href="/div">here</a><span style="color:rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.63); font-size: small;">➚</span> :)<br><br>
          Remember, its a prediction don't get mad at me, though I think it's pretty accurate but yeah you can always do better (or worse) or simply don't care and just walk away. I'm curious to see how accurate or close it turns out to be. Also apart from prediction thing, it can also help you to see where your marks are going based on your previous performances and you can improve your results.
